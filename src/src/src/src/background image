CSS background-image

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the <p> element:
p {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
